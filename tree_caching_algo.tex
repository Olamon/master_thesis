\section{Tree caching with dependencies}
The problem we consider (called \textit{tree caching problem})is an extension 
of classic caching problem with bypassing that was recalled in secion 2. The 
main difference is that requested items have inter-dependencies. Specifically, 
universe forms rooted tree $T$ and the items requested are placed in its nodes 
and whenever $v \in T$ is fetched all of its descendants $T(v)$ that are not in 
cache have to be fetched at the same time. We say that the cache with property 
described above is \textit{bottom-contiguous}.

Moreover, we consider two types of requests: \textit{negative} and 
\textit{positive}. If incomming request is positive we pay 1 if it is 
not present in the cache (so the same as in most considered settings). On the 
other hand we pay for negative requests if the item is cached (so in opposite 
situation). After serving of any request we can reorgenize cache paying 
$\alpha \geq 1$ for every element evicted or fetched. 

The goal is to minimize the cost obtained by online algorithm solving this 
problem. We present a deterministic algorithm \textbf{TRC} which we prove is 
$O(h(T) \times R)$-competitive where $h(T)$ is height of input tree and $R = 
k_{ONL}/(k_{ONL} - k_{OPT} +1$ with $k_{ONL}$ and $k_{OPT}$ being size of 
online and optimal offline algorithm cache.

\subsection{Model}
For ease of future algorithm description and readability of proofs we define 
some usefull objects. First of all by $T(r)$ we mean subtree of $T$ rooted in 
$r$ and $h(T)$ denotes height of tree.
